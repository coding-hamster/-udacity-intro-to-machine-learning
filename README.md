# -udacity-intro-to-machine-learning

This was the first course made in learn-by-doing approach I managed to find.
As I was interested mostly in machine learning itself files here might look weird. Still these are completed tasks 
for the course in python 3. As course is based on Python 2 some answers can be considered as mistakes 
on pages of the course.
